- I'm a professional Android Application Developer with a dozen apps made by me. But I don't own the apps as they are made for the company I work for.

- I also have intermediate Flutter experiance, but enough to build apps using that platform.

- You can check out the code I have open-sourced in my Repositories, but some are not exactly up to date because of work.
